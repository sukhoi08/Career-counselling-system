# Career-counselling-system
In today’s dynamic professional landscape, career decision-making has become increasingly complex, influenced by a multitude of academic, personal, and experiential factors. As students and professionals navigate an expanding array of career opportunities across diverse sectors—such as technology, business, healthcare, and design—access to intelligent, data-driven guidance tools is more critical than ever.
Our proposed AI Career Counseling System tackles these challenges through the use of robust machine learning techniques, trained on diverse, preprocessed datasets that capture a wide range of academic and professional attributes. By incorporating features such as age, GPA, gender, field of study, university location, coursework, employment history, and entrepreneurial aspirations, the system is capable of delivering nuanced and individualized career path suggestions across multiple domains.
